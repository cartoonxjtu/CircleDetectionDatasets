# Dataset for Circle Detection
 The dataset is created for testing circle detection algorithms. It contains five categories which cover a wide spectrum of images. The five categories are:
  * bubble
  * cell
  * sign 
  * traffic
  * coin
  
  Each of them is named after the objects presented in its images. 

## Data Summary:

| Category | \#Images | \#Instances | Color | Source |
|:-------: |:--------:|:-----------:|:-----:|:------:|
|   **Bubble**  |  $32$   |  $666$  | Gray  | Microscopic Image|
| **Cell**      | $45$    | $2911$  | Gray  | Microscopic Image|
| **Sign**      | $117$   | $246$   | RGB   | Natural Image|
| **Seal**      | $14$    | $94$    | Binary| Scanned Document|
| **Coin**      | $17$    | $100$   | Gray  | Photography Trakcen under Artifical Lighting|


## Data Description:

[1]. <font size=3>*Bubble*</font>: Images in the category come from a chemical experiment that involves tracing the quickly moving bubbles. Each image in the category is a photo montage generated by a sequence of pictures taken by a high-speed microscopic camera. Due to the imaging conditions, most of its $666$ instances suffer from the deformation; part of their boundaries are missing and the rest of their boundaries are heavily blurred making the edge detection hard to distinguish the bubbles from the background. Besides, the reflection of light casts a lot of bright spots on the bubbles, bringing in the false positives. These challenging factors prevent the detection of bubbles from achieving high accuracy.

[2]. <font size=3>*Cell*</font>: This category possesses $45$ images collected from the blood test of several patients. Some of their blood cells lack pits, our circle detection is used to count the number of cells without pit. All images in the category are taken by the electronic microscope and rescaled to $512\times 512$. Though image count of the category ranks $2$, it has the most instances whose count is $2911$. The mutual occlusion among these instances is a challenge that cannot be neglected. Besides, mature RBCs often have a pit in the center. Contour of the pit and the boundary of the whole cell compose a ring. For ground truth, we labeled the cell as one instance and neglected its pit. Thus, the detection algorithm should deal with the concentric circles presented in almost each cell.  

[3]. <font size=3>*Seal*</font>: All the $14$ documents in the category are scanned with $300$ DPI and then re-scaled with the longer edge equaling to $1024$. To detect these circular seals is a necessary step towards the understanding of the image contents that leads to further compact representation. However, the cluttered backgrounds composed of characters and some other shapes increase the difficulty for accurate detection. 

[4]. <font size=3>*Sign*</font>: Its $117$ images come from three sources. Some were collected from Flickr\cite{flickr}, some are photographs by our own with a hand-held camera, and the rest were shot by cameras fixed in an unmanned car. In the category, we try localize the circular traffic signs in the natural environment that can be further used for automatic navigation. Due to the shooting positions and angles, circular traffic signs in the test images have considerable deformations led by out-of-plane rotation, and the radii of all the $246$ instances scatter in a very wide range from $3$ pixels to $120$ pixels. Besides, as we can see in Fig.\ref{fig:imagesamples}, existence of the concentric circles are inevitable; all these factors along with the cluttered backgrounds make the accurate detection very hard. 

[5]. <font size=3>*Coin*</font>: There are $17$ gray images in this category with instances amounting to $100$. All are photographed under the artificial lighting in our laboratory and are rescaled to $512\times 384$. For an image, instances in it have around the same size. Circle detection is involved for counting the coins. Occlusions and the cluttered backgrounds are the main challenges of the category.

## Data Format:

Each category is organized in a separate directory with the same name. The directory contains a 'Images' sub-directory for the images and a â€˜Label' one for the labels. 

```
.    
-- Bubble
|   -- Images
|   -- Labels
-- Cell
|   -- Images
|   -- Labels
-- Seal
|   -- Images
|   -- Labels
-- Sign
|   -- Images
|   -- Labels
-- Coin
|   -- Images
|   -- Labels
```

As for each image in the 'Images' subdirectory, there is a corresponding text file contained in 'Labels'  taht saves the labeled circles in the image. Each record in the text file gives a circle instance represented by $(x,y,r)$ with $(x,y)$ its center and $r$ the radius.
